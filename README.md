<h2>Software Engineering Project for CSC 510 : Phase V</h2>

Teacher's Pet is a Discord Bot for class instructors to streamline their Discord servers. Discord is a great tool for communication and its functionalities can be enhanced by bots and integrations.

For 5.0, we created new tools for instructors and students to use to improve course communication. After version 4.0's success, we decided we wanted to improve upon some of its features including spam, profanity settings, penalty, awarding-penalize XP, QNA channel etc. Our main objective for 5.0 was to make using Discord a more controlled and enjoyable experience.

<h2>Bot Features</h2>

[Click here to see the features of iterations I, II, III and IV.](docs/feature-history.md)

1. **Custom profanity settings**  
   Users entering NSFW messages can be warned, timed-out, or banned based on instructor-defined or default settings—warning, timeout, followed by server ban
2. **Persistent Block from server**  
   Banned users remain blocked; when the bot restarts, attempting reentry leads to an automatic kick if the bot is offline. Online attempts are barred
3. **Instructor Channel**  
   Tagging instructors results in questions being posted in the instructor QNA channel; replies posted back to the main channel, ensuring no question goes unnoticed
4. **DB initialization**
   Proper integration with databases ensures new user entry upon bot restart; detects and creates missing user database entries on server join
5. **Spam Violation penalty**
   Users receive 10XP penalty for spamming, enhancing the XP-based ranking system and receiving timeouts for improper behavior
6. **NSFW violation penalty**
   Custom XP penalties set by instructors for users posting NSFW messages in chat channels
7. **!Award XP**  
   Instructors award XP to users in the instructor channel for encouraging positive behaviors
8. **!Penalize XP**  
   Instructors can reduce XP for reasons like invalid input or irrelevant discussions
9. **!Leaderboard**  
   Users access top 10 rankers' leaderboard based on their ranks and XP
10. **!unblock_user**  
    Instructors gain authority to unblock users by usernames, allowing banned individuals to rejoin

<h2> Future Scope </h2>

This bot has endless possibilities for functionality. Features which we are interested in adding but did not have time for include but are not limited to:

- Add Tutor role
- Add ways for users to lose exp in the rank feature(spamming etc)
- Add commands so an instructor can customize how rank exp is awarded(what for and how much etc)
- Refactor code to use cogs
- Add a gibberish detector that deletes comments that are irrelevant to the class
- Funnel the AI chat responses to a limited set(so AI only answers questions an instructor wants them to answer)
- Upgrade to a better chatbot API that is free
